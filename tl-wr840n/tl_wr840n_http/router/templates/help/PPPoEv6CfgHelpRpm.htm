<p class="connect"><B>Connect on Demand</B> - You can configure the Router to disconnect your Internet connection after a specified period of the Internet connectivity (<B>Max Idle Time</B>). If your Internet connection has been terminated due to inactivity, <B>Connect on Demand </B> enables the Router to automatically re-establish your connection when you attempt to access the Internet again. If you wish to activate <B>Connect on Demand</B>, put a check mark in the circle. If you want your Internet connection to remain active all the times, enter <B>0</B> in the <B>Max Idle Time</B> field. </p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Sometimes the connection cannot be disconnected although you specify a time to <B>Max Idle Time</B>(0~99 mins) because some applications visit the Internet continually in the background.</p>
<p class="connect_auto"> <strong>Connect Automatically</strong> - Connect automatically after the Router is disconnected. To use this option, click the radio button.</p>
<p class="connecting"><B>Time-based Connecting</B> - You can configure the Router to make it connect or disconnect based on time. Enter the start time in HH-MM for connecting and end time in HH-MM for disconnecting in the <B>Period of Time</B> fields.</p>
<p class="connect_manu"> <strong>Connect Manually</strong> - You can configure the Router to make it connect or disconnect manually. After a specified period of inactivity (<B>Max Idle Time</B>), the Router will disconnect your Internet connection, and not be able to re-establish your connection automatically as soon as you attempt to access the Internet again. To use this option, click the radio button. If you want your Internet connection to remain active all the times, enter <B>0</B> in the <B>Max Idle Time</B> field. Otherwise, enter the number in minutes that you wish to have the Internet connecting last unless a new link requested.</p>
<p class="note_0"><strong>Note:</strong> Sometimes the connection cannot be disconnected although you specify a <B>Max Idle Time</B>(0~99 mins) because some applications visit the Internet continually in the background.</p>

<p class="note_1"><B>Note:</B> Only when you have set the system time on <B>System Tools</B> -> <B>Time Settings</B> page, the <B>Time-based Connecting</B> function can take effect. </p>
